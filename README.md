NVIM DOTFILES
================================================================================

This is my [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) dotfiles. I forked it from the wonderful
[kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) because I couldn't figure out
how to get [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) working with my original config.

Features:

- Abbreviations.

## Abbreviations

- For some reason, [UltiSnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips) is very laggy on one of my computers.
- I put [Vim abbreviations](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Using_abbreviations) in my `ftplugin` folder.
  `sh.vim` contains bash abbreviations, `python.vim` contains Python abbreviations, etc.
- Abbreviations start with `#` so I don't accidentally trigger them
